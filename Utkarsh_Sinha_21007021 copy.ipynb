The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two\\r\\n   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed\\r\\n   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:\\r\\n   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The\\r\\n   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve\\r\\n   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error.
